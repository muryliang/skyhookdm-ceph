## Current Support
This is an experimental project at this time. As such, only a small factor of SQL syntax is support as of now. 

Currently, SELECT-FROM query statements are supported. 

## Upcoming Updates
* `WHERE` and `LIKE` clause support
* Subquery support in `WHERE` clauses. 
* Options for --use-cls, --quiet. 
* Basic aggregation queries.
* Fix issue joins in `FROM` clauses to be comma separate strings when parsed.
* Support for SQL files as an alternative to python shell.
